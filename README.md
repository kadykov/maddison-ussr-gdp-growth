# USSR GDP Growth Analysis

This repository contains a detailed analysis of USSR's GDP growth based on the Maddison Project Database. The project was motivated by claims made in the book "GROWTH CRYSTAL. FOR THE RUSSIAN ECONOMIC MIRACLE" (https://crystalbook.ru/) which stated that the USSR's GDP growth was 13.8% per year during 1929-1955 (excluding 1941-1945).

## Motivation

The analysis was initiated to fact-check claims about extraordinary Soviet economic growth rates. Specifically, the book "GROWTH CRYSTAL" claimed a 13.8% annual GDP growth rate for the USSR during 1929-1955 (excluding WWII years). However, our analysis of the same Maddison Project Database shows a significantly lower growth rate of approximately 4.3% per year for this period.

## Key Findings

- The actual GDP growth rate during 1929-1955 (excluding 1941-1945) was approximately 4.3% per year, not 13.8% as claimed
- The analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of growth rates across different periods of Soviet history
- The data demonstrates that while the USSR did experience significant economic growth, it was not as extraordinary as sometimes claimed in certain publications
