# Year-by-Year Analysis of USSR's Economic Growth

While our [Period Analysis](periods.qmd) focuses on average growth rates during specific historical periods, particularly addressing the claim of 13.8% growth during 1929-1955, this page provides a more detailed, year-by-year view of the USSR's economic performance.

## Purpose of This Analysis

1. **Detailed Growth Patterns**: By examining annual data points rather than period averages, we can:
   - Identify specific years of exceptional growth or decline
   - Observe the volatility of growth rates
   - See the immediate impact of major historical events

2. **Data Transparency**: The year-by-year presentation allows readers to:
   - Verify our calculations
   - Conduct their own analysis of specific time periods
   - Better understand the underlying data used in our period averages

3. **Growth Rate Variations**: The analysis shows both total GDP and GDP per capita growth rates, helping to:
   - Distinguish between total economic growth and individual prosperity
   - Account for population changes in economic performance
   - Provide a more complete picture of economic development

Below are the visualizations and data showing the annual growth rates throughout the entire period covered by the Maddison Project Database.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import requests
from pathlib import Path

# Read the Excel file
df = pd.read_excel("mpd2018.xlsx", sheet_name="Full data")

# Filter for Former USSR
ussr_data = df[df['country'] == 'Former USSR'].copy()

# Sort by year
ussr_data = ussr_data.sort_values('year')

# Remove data before 1884
ussr_data = ussr_data[ussr_data['year'] >= 1884]

# Calculate GDP (using population and GDP per capita)
ussr_data['total_gdp'] = ussr_data['rgdpnapc'] * ussr_data['pop'] * 1000  # pop is in thousands

# Calculate year-over-year growth rates
ussr_data['gdp_growth'] = ussr_data['total_gdp'].pct_change(fill_method=None) * 100
ussr_data['gdp_per_capita_growth'] = ussr_data['rgdpnapc'].pct_change(fill_method=None) * 100
```

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "GDP Growth Rate"
# Plot 1: GDP Growth Rate
plt.plot(ussr_data['year'], ussr_data['gdp_growth'], marker='o')
plt.title('USSR GDP Growth Rate (%)')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Growth Rate (%)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

```{python}
#| fig-cap: "GDP per Capita Growth Rate"
# Plot 2: GDP per Capita Growth Rate
plt.plot(ussr_data['year'], ussr_data['gdp_per_capita_growth'], marker='o', color='orange')
plt.title('USSR GDP per Capita Growth Rate (%)')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Growth Rate (%)')
plt.grid(True)

plt.tight_layout()

```{python}
# Display summary statistics
print("\nUSSR GDP Growth Analysis")
print("-" * 30)
print(f"Data period: {ussr_data['year'].min()} - {ussr_data['year'].max()}")
print(f"\nAverage GDP growth rate: {ussr_data['gdp_growth'].mean():.2f}%")
print(f"Average GDP per capita growth rate: {ussr_data['gdp_per_capita_growth'].mean():.2f}%")
print(f"\nHighest GDP growth: {ussr_data['gdp_growth'].max():.2f}% (Year: {ussr_data.loc[ussr_data['gdp_growth'].idxmax(), 'year']})")
print(f"Lowest GDP growth: {ussr_data['gdp_growth'].min():.2f}% (Year: {ussr_data.loc[ussr_data['gdp_growth'].idxmin(), 'year']})")

# Display the data table
display(ussr_data[['year', 'gdp_growth', 'gdp_per_capita_growth']].round(2))

## Key Observations from Year-by-Year Analysis

The annual data reveals several important patterns that complement our period analysis:

1. **Growth Volatility**
   - Economic growth was highly volatile throughout the Soviet period
   - The most extreme fluctuations occurred during periods of major historical events (wars, revolutions, reforms)
   - This volatility is somewhat masked when looking at period averages

2. **Growth Peaks and Troughs**
   - The highest growth rates were typically observed during recovery periods (post-Civil War, post-WWII)
   - The deepest declines coincided with major conflicts and political transitions
   - The claimed 13.8% sustained growth rate would have been exceptional even compared to the best individual years

3. **GDP vs GDP per Capita**
   - Total GDP growth often exceeded per capita growth, reflecting population growth
   - The gap between total and per capita growth varied significantly across different periods
   - This difference is crucial for understanding actual improvements in living standards

4. **Data Patterns**
   - The year-by-year data shows no sustained period of double-digit growth that would support the 13.8% claim
   - Growth rates were generally more modest and variable than suggested by period averages alone
   - The data exhibits clear patterns corresponding to known historical events and policy changes

This detailed view reinforces our findings from the period analysis while providing additional context about the variability and patterns of Soviet economic growth.
