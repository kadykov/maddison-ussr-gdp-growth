title: "USSR GDP Growth Analysis"
---

This website presents an analysis of the USSR's GDP growth using data from the Maddison Project Database 2018. The analysis covers various periods in Soviet history, from pre-revolutionary times to the post-Soviet era, with a particular focus on verifying claims about extraordinary growth rates during the Soviet period.

## Motivation

This analysis was motivated by claims made in the book "GROWTH CRYSTAL. FOR THE RUSSIAN ECONOMIC MIRACLE" ([website](https://crystalbook.ru/)), which asserted that the USSR achieved an extraordinary GDP growth rate of 13.8% per year during the period 1929-1955 (excluding the World War II years of 1941-1945). The authors claimed to base their calculations on the Maddison Project Database.

Our careful analysis of the same database reveals a significantly different picture. The actual growth rate for this period was approximately 4.3% per year - still substantial, but far from the claimed 13.8%. This discrepancy prompted a thorough investigation of Soviet economic growth across various historical periods.

## Key Findings

1. **Growth Rate Verification**: The actual GDP growth rate during 1929-1955 (excluding 1941-1945) was approximately 4.3% per year, not 13.8% as claimed in some sources.

2. **Historical Context**: While the Soviet Union did achieve significant economic growth during various periods, the rates were more modest than sometimes portrayed in certain publications.

3. **Period Analysis**: Different periods of Soviet history showed varying growth patterns, influenced by factors such as industrialization policies, war recovery, and economic reforms.

## Data Source

The data comes from the [Maddison Project Database 2018](https://www.rug.nl/ggdc/historicaldevelopment/maddison/), which provides estimates of GDP per capita for countries worldwide over a long historical period. The database is maintained by the Groningen Growth and Development Centre at the University of Groningen.

## Key Metrics

The analysis focuses on two main metrics:

1. **Total GDP Growth**: The year-over-year change in total GDP
2. **GDP per Capita Growth**: The year-over-year change in GDP per capita

## Historical Periods

We analyze the following key periods:

- Pre-Revolutionary Period (1885-1913)
- World War I and Civil War (1914-1920)
- NEP Period (1921-1928)
- Early Soviet Industrialization (1929-1941)
- World War II (1941-1945)
- Post-War Recovery (1945-1955)
- Late Soviet Period (1956-1991)
- Post-Soviet Crisis (1992-1998)
- Recovery and Growth (1999-2019)
